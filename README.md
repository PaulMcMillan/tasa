T-A S.A.
====

A simple redis-powered task queue and job system. Designed to be
easily extensible with code, rather than excessively featureful out of
the box.

Getting Started
---------------

Tasa requires a version of Python 2.7. If you're using an older
version, now is an excellent time to upgrade. If you're running Python
3, compatibility patches are welcome.

Make sure you have redis and the python redis bindings installed. If
you're using a remote redis instance, you can set the `REDIS_ADDRESS`
environment variable.
