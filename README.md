T-A S.A.
====

A simple redis-powered task queue and job system. Designed to be
easily extensible with code, rather than excessively featureful out of
the box.

Getting Started
---------------

Make sure you have redis and the python redis bindings installed. If
you're using a remote redis instance, you can set the `REDIS_ADDRESS`
environment variable.
